# Data Cleaning
This page contains a few small data visualizations that I created for CO2 emissions generated by UM Athletics facilities. The data was obtained from the Office of Campus Sustainability and you can see it portrayed in a much better (?) way on their website: <https://ocs.umich.edu/resources/sustainability-data/building-energy-data/> 

Before I could create the visualizations I had to clean up the data a bit and organize it the way I wanted.


```r

library(plyr)
library(dplyr)
## 
## Attaching package: 'dplyr'
## The following objects are masked from 'package:plyr':
## 
##     arrange, count, desc, failwith, id, mutate, rename, summarise,
##     summarize
## The following objects are masked from 'package:stats':
## 
##     filter, lag
## The following objects are masked from 'package:base':
## 
##     intersect, setdiff, setequal, union
library(tidyr)

# Visualizations

I created a visualization for all of 2022's emissions data associated with their scope 2 emissions. Scope 2 emissions are emissions associated with purchased electricity, steam, heating and cooling. Most buildings will only purchase electricity, and will generate their own heating, through natural gas furnace or electric heater. A few buidlings on campus purchase steam as the graph will show you.
